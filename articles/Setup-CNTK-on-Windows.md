# Setup CNTK on Windows

If you want to build manually CNTK from source code on Windows using Visual Studio 2017, this page is for you. 

If you are looking for any other kind of support to setup a CNTK build environment or installing CNTK on your system, you should go [here](./Setup-CNTK-on-your-machine.md) instead. 

> [!NOTE]
> This page assumes that you are trying to build CNTK's master branch.

## 64-bit OS

CNTK requires a 64-bit Windows installation. We tested the build process on Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and Windows Server 2012 R2 and later. Other environments are not officially supported. For compatibility issues check [CNTK Production Build and Test configuration](./Test-Configurations.md).

## Environment Variables and Components

Building CNTK on your system requires the definition and configuration of various environment variables. An overview of environment variables used by the Windows build of CNTK can be found on [this page](./Windows-Environment-Variables.md). In addition, this page gives an overview of **required and optional components** for building CNTK as well as their default install location. 

## Visual Studio 2017

Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 for Windows. A link to the download can be found [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).

The Community Version of Visual Studio 2017 is sufficient to build CNTK.

During the installation process, please select Desktop development with C++ workload:

![im1](./pictures/setup/VS2017Workloads.jpg)

Besides, On the individual components screen make sure you add 'VC++ 2017 version 15.4 v14.11 toolset' to your installation for build with CUDA 9.0:

![im1](./pictures/setup/VS2017VCTools14.11.jpg)

### Preexisting Visual Studio 2017 installation

You are also required to have the 'VC++ 2017 version 15.4 v14.11 toolset' installed on your system. To check open the Windows "Control Panel -> Programs -> Programs and Features' and select 'Visual Studio Community 2017' from the list of installed programs. This will start the Visual Studio setup again and allows you to make sure the 'VC++ 2017 version 15.4 v14.11 toolset' feature is installed on your system (see picture above).

> [!NOTE]
> If `VS2017INSTALLDIR` environment variable was not set by the Visual Studio installer, set it manually. The exact installation directory depends on both the *version* (2017 in this case) and *offering* (*Community*, *Enterprise*, etc) of Visual Studio, according to the following pattern: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\<version>\<offering>`.
>
> For *Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise* edition, run:
> ```
> setx VS2017INSTALLDIR "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise"
> ```
> For *Visual Studio 2017 Community* edition, run:
> ```
> setx VS2017INSTALLDIR "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community"
> ```

## Git

Git is required to work with the CNTK code base. You may use the following tools:

* [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). This is the standard command line client for Git, which we will use on this page to describe the enlisting in the CNTK repository. 

* A Git client is available as a part of the Visual Studio 2017 installation. Read the blog post [Microsoft Application Lifecycle Management](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2013/02/06/create-connect-and-publish-using-visual-studio-with-git/) about using the built-in Git client.

* [GitHub Desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/)

### Enlisting in the CNTK GitHub repository

Here we assume you installed [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). We assume you installed Git using the default options in the Git installer (Especially 'Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt' and with the option "Checkout Windows-style, commit UNIX-style line endings" at the "Configuring line endings" prompt enabled.

Create a clone of the CNTK source code in `c:\repos\cntk` directory. If you prefer a different location, you will need to adjust the commands accordingly. 

Open a standard windows command shell, and execute these command

```
c: && md \repos && cd \repos
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/cntk
cd cntk
git submodule update --init external/gsl
git submodule update --init Source/CNTKv2LibraryDll/proto/onnx/onnx_repo
git submodule update --init Source/Multiverso
```

This puts all the required source code for a standard build onto your system. If you plan on making modifications to the CNTK code, you should read the information on [Developing and Testing](./Developing-and-Testing.md).

The submodule Multiverso is used to enable [DataParallelASGD](./Multiple-GPUs-and-machines.md) for training. If you don't need DataParallelASGD support, then add the environment variable CNTK_ENABLE_ASGD and set its value to false. E.g. run this in a CMD prompt, and then reopen your CMD shell(s) and Visual Studio to pick up the change:

```
setx CNTK_ENABLE_ASGD false
```

##  MKL

The default CNTK math library is the [Intel Math Kernel Library (Intel MKL)](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl/). Follow [this page](./Setup-MKL-on-Windows.md) to install it

### MKL-DNN
* Download MKL-DNN source and build with MKL_PATH as target path. Check build instructions in [Setup MKL-DNN on Windows](./Setup-BuildMklDnn-VS17.md)

* Set the environment variable `MKL_PATH` to the directory, e.g.:

```
    setx MKL_PATH c:\local\mklml-mkldnn-0.14
```

## MS-MPI

Install version 7 (7.0.12437.6) of Microsoft MPI (MS-MPI) from [this download page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49926), marked simply as "Version 7" in the page title. Click on the Download button, and then select both `msmpisdk.msi` and `MSMpiSetup.exe`.

## Boost

Follow these steps to install the [Boost Library](http://www.boost.org/) on your system:

* Download and install Boost version 1.60 (you need the `msvc-14.0` binaries) from this <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.60.0/boost_1_60_0-msvc-14.0-64.exe/download" target="_blank">download location</a> on Sourceforge.
* Set the environment variable `BOOST_INCLUDE_PATH` to your Boost installation, e.g.: 

```
    setx BOOST_INCLUDE_PATH c:\local\boost_1_60_0-msvc-14.0
```

* Set the environment variable `BOOST_LIB_PATH` to the Boost libraries, e.g.: 

```
    setx BOOST_LIB_PATH c:\local\boost_1_60_0-msvc-14.0\lib64-msvc-14.0
```

* To integrate the Boost test framework into Visual Studio you can install a runner for Boost tests in Visual Studio from the <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/5f4ae1bd-b769-410e-8238-fb30beda987f" target="_blank">Visual Studio Gallery</a>.

## Protobuf

You need a version of Protobuf 3.1.0 compiled for CNTK. You can compile this version by yourself, or use an already (precompiled) prepared version of Protobuf 3.1.0 (described on this page). If you want to build the Protobuf library for CNTK on your system, you can find the details [here](./Setup-BuildProtobuf-VS17.md)

Download the ZIP file containing the precompiled version of Protobuf for CNTK from [this location](https://cntk.ai/binarydrop/prerequisites/protobuf/protobuf-3.1.0-vs15.zip)

Extract the archive to a folder on your local disk, e.g. to `C:\local\protobuf-3.1.0-vs15` and set the environment variable `PROTOBUF_PATH` pointing to that location, e.g.: 

```
    setx PROTOBUF_PATH c:\local\protobuf-3.1.0-vs15
```

## GPU Specific Packages

This section outlines the packages you need to setup in order for CNTK to leverage NVIDIA GPUs. 

If you do NOT intend to use any GPUs with CNTK and will rely on the CPU only, you may skip directly to the [next general section](#optional-swig). Otherwise proceed to [this page](./Setup-GPU-Specific-Packages.md).

Set the environment variable `CUDNN_PATH` pointing to that location, e.g.: 

```
    setx CUDNN_PATH C:\local\cudnn-9.0-v7.0\cuda
```

Set the environment variable `CUB_PATH` pointing to that location, e.g.:

```
    setx CUB_PATH c:\local\cub-1.7.4\
```

## OPTIONAL. SWIG.

If you want to take advantage of CNTK from Python, you will need to install [SWIG](http://swig.org). SWIG is also a requirement to build the CNTK Evaluation libraries (for C#/.NET or Java).

Please download the version `SWIG 3.0.10` from [this site](https://sourceforge.net/projects/swig/files/swigwin/).

Extract the archive to a folder on your local disk, e.g. to `C:\local\swigwin-3.0.10` and set the environment variable `SWIG_PATH` pointing to that location, e.g.: 

```
    setx SWIG_PATH C:\local\swigwin-3.0.10
```

Quick installation check: If you followed the instruction above and used the same paths, the command `dir C:\local\swigwin-3.0.10\swig.exe` will succeed and show one file.

## OPTIONAL. OpenCV

CNTK 2.2 requires [Open Source Computer Vision (OpenCV)](http://opencv.org/) to be installed but it is optional for CNTK 2.3. Follow [this page](./Setup-OpenCV-on-Windows.md) for further steps.

Set the environment variable `OPENCV_PATH_V31` pointing to the OpenCV build folder, e.g.

```
setx OPENCV_PATH_V31 c:\local\Opencv3.1.0\build
```

Quick installation check: If you followed the instruction above and used the same paths, the command `dir C:\local\Opencv3.1.0\build` will succeed.

## OPTIONAL. zlib and libzip

If you plan to build the **CNTK Image Reader** you require [zlib](http://zlib.net/) and [libzip](http://nih.at/libzip/) libraries. 

## zlib and libzip

The ZLib and LibZip are distributed in source code, you will need to recompile these packages, you can also use a precompiled version we created for your convenience (described in this section). To build the libraries yourself, you find detailed instructions [here](./Setup-Buildzlib-VS17.md)

Download the ZIP file containing the precompiled version of libzip/zlib compression library for CNTK from [this location](https://cntk.ai/binarydrop/prerequisites/zip/zlib-vs15.zip)

Extract the archive to a folder on your local disk, e.g. to `C:\local\zlib-vs15` and set the environment variable `ZLIB_PATH` pointing to that location, e.g.: 

```
    setx ZLIB_PATH c:\local\zlib-vs15
```

Quick installation check: If you followed the instruction above and used the same paths, the command `dir C:\local\zlib-vs15\bin` will succeed and show a couple of DLLs.

## OPTIONAL. Anaconda Python Installation

If you plan to build CNTK with Python support, install [SWIG](#optional-swig) if you have not done so yet. Also, you will need a Python environment. We use Anaconda Python for our default Python installation. 

If you do not have an Anaconda installation: install [Anaconda Python for Windows](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.1.1-Windows-x86_64.exe). 
You can follow the standard configuration given in the install program (InstallationType=JustMe; AddToPath=No; RegisterPython=No). In the following we assume you installed Python `Anaconda3 4.1.1` into `C:\local\Anaconda3-4.1.1-Windows-x86_64`.

## OPTIONAL. CNTK UWP Build

[!INCLUDE[versionadded-2.1-block](includes/versionadded-2.1-block.md)]

If you want to build the CNTK Evaluation Library for UWP you need to follow the additional installation steps described [here](./Setup-UWP-Build-on-Windows.md).

### CNTK Python environments

CNTK supports Python 2.7, Python 3.5 and Python 3.6. We recommend you create a dedicated environment in your Python installation to work with CNTK. This way CNTK and the installed supporting packages won't impact any other Python project. We provide several files (`yml`-files) containing the description of required Python packages. The packages are located in the `scripts\install\windows` directory inside your CNTK clone. Please select the file matching your targeted Python version.

|Python version | Filename |
|:--------|:------------|
|Python 2.7 | conda-windows-cntk-py27-environment.yml
|Python 3.5 | conda-windows-cntk-py35-environment.yml
|Python 3.6 | conda-windows-cntk-py36-environment.yml

As an example we create a Python 3.5 environment in an environment named `cntk-py35`. If you want a different environment name, please adjust the following steps accordingly. If you want to create a Python 2.7 or Python 3.6 environment, please adjust the name of the YML to match the Python version you intend to use.

The following assumes you cloned the CNTK source code from GitHub into the directory `c:\repos\cntk`.

* To create a new conda environment (e.g. `cntk-py35`) and activate it, run the following commands from the Windows command shell:

```
    cd C:\local\Anaconda3-4.1.1-Windows-x86_64\scripts
    conda env create --file c:\repos\cntk\scripts\install\windows\conda-windows-cntk-py35-environment.yml  --name cntk-py35
    activate C:\local\Anaconda3-4.1.1-Windows-x86_64\envs\cntk-py35
```

If you have an environment (e.g. `cntk-py35`) you can update it with the latest required packages with the following commands:

```
    cd C:\local\Anaconda3-4.1.1-Windows-x86_64\scripts
    conda env update --file c:\repos\cntk\scripts\install\windows\conda-windows-cntk-py35-environment.yml --name cntk-py35
    activate C:\local\Anaconda3-4.1.1-Windows-x86_64\envs\cntk-py35
```

### CNTK Environment Variables for Python

Before you start the build of CNTK and build the Python libraries for CNTK, you need to set/define environment variables `CNTK_PY.._PATH` and `PYTHONPATH`

#### CNTK_PY.._PATH

Set up build environment variables for your Python environment (choose at least one that applies):

```
    setx CNTK_PY36_PATH [paths for your Python 3.6 environment]
    setx CNTK_PY35_PATH [paths for your Python 3.5 environment]
    setx CNTK_PY27_PATH [paths for your Python 2.7 environment]
```

If you followed the installation so far, this would mean

```
    setx CNTK_PY35_PATH C:\local\Anaconda3-4.1.1-Windows-x86_64\envs\cntk-py35
```

The value for the `CNTK_PY36_PATH`, `CNTK_PY35_PATH`, or `CNTK_PY27_PATH` environment variables can be determined by running in
`conda ..activate cmd.exe [name-or-path-of-your-environment]`

#### PYTHONPATH

`PYTHONPATH` sets the paths to the places Python will look for modules to import. If you build CNTK, you need to add the output path of the build process to this environment variable. If you cloned CNTK into `c:\repos\cntk` this will be

```
    setx PYTHONPATH c:\repos\cntk\bindings\python;%PYTHONPATH%
```

## OPTIONAL. Java

To build the Java bindings for the CNTK Evaluation library, install the [SWIG tool](#optional-swig) if you have not done so yet. Also, a Java Development Kit (JDK) is required. Currently we use 64 bit [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) (JDK Version 1.8.0_131).

Set the environment variable JAVA_HOME to point to the directory of Java installation. The following setting assumes that you have installed JDK 1.8.0_131 to C:\local\jdk1.8.0_131:

```
    setx JAVA_HOME "c:\local\jdk1.8.0_131"
```

## Uninstall previous CNTK versions

If you previously installed any version of the CNTK Python package on your machine, uninstall it by first removing any CNTK related paths in the PYTHONPATH environment variable. Do: `echo %PYTHONPATH%` to see its current value, and then use the `setx` command to set PYTHONPATH such that the CNTK related paths are gone.  If that makes PYTHONPATH empty, so be it.

Do the uninstall: `pip uninstall cntk`

----------

This concludes the installation portion. Let's continue with building CNTK

----------

## Building CNTK

Currently there's a compatibility issue between CUDA 9 and default VCTools in Visual Studio 2017. CNTK requires VCTools 14.11 to build with CUDA 9. To do that:

* Open Command Prompt
* call "%VS2017INSTALLDIR%\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" amd64 -vcvars_ver=14.11

This will set VCTools to the CUDA 9 compatible version. From the Command Prompt, start CNTK.sln in the root of the cloned CNTK project from GitHub. If CNTK.sln runs with the default CUDA9-incompatible version of VCTools, there will be build errors like "1>c:\program files\nvidia gpu computing toolkit\cuda\v9.0\include\crt/host_config.h(133): fatal error C1189: #error:  -- unsupported Microsoft Visual Studio version! Only the versions 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2017 are supported!"

If you just changed and environment variable, you should close any already opened Visual Studio instance, otherwise the content of changed environment variables will not be reflected inside Visual Studio.

* Right-click the CNTK Solution in Solution Explorer and select `Properties`
* In the opened window select `Configuration Properties` and press `Configuration Manager...` button
* In Configuration Manager select the desired configuration:
  * Debug or Release
  * GPU or CPU-only. CPU-only configurations are explicitly named. All other configurations imply GPU usage (i.e. `Release` means *Release. GPU enabled mode*)
  * You should always select CPU-only configurations if you have NOT installed the [components required for GPU configurations](#gpu-specific-packages)

Build the CNTK solution. The components created by the build process are dependent on the prerequisites you installed, for details the page detailing [Windows Environment Variables](./Windows-Environment-Variables.md) should be consulted.

If you build Python modules note: 

* Python modules are only created in the `Release` configuration
* This will build the CNTK Python module inside `bindings\python\cntk` and also produce a package (`.whl`) in a subfolder `Python` of your build output folder (e.g., `x64\Release\Python`)
* Make sure your path includes the build output folder (e.g., `x64\Release`), and that `PYTHONPATH` includes the `bindings\python` directory. This is contrary to the setup shown for the Pip package installation, here we will load the CNTK module from the CNTK repository clone, not as an installed package in your Python environment, hence also the difference in setting up `PYTHONPATH`.

## Test of CNTK build functionality

To ensure that CNTK is working properly in your system, you can quickly run an example from the
[Hello World - Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/release/latest/Tutorials/HelloWorld-LogisticRegression) tutorial.
This example trains a simple network and can be directed to use either CPU or GPU, which helps quickly ensure that CNTK is
functioning properly.

Below we assume that the CNTK repository is cloned to `c:\repos\cntk` and `build\x64\release` was used as a sub-directory for the (Release) build.

* Open Command Prompt
* Provide the path to the CNTK binaries (via Environment Variable or for Command Prompt session using the first command below) and change to the `Tutorials\HelloWorld-LogisticRegression` directory:

```
set PATH=C:\repos\cntk\x64\release;%PATH%
cd C:\repos\cntk\Tutorials\HelloWorld-LogisticRegression
```

First try the example:

```
cntk configFile=lr_bs.cntk makeMode=false
```

If the sample runs, i.e. if there are no error messages, you will get an output related first to reading the configuration, followed
by the output of the actual network training.

### Trying CNTK with GPU

If you built CNTK for GPU usage, try using GPU by executing the following command:

```
cntk configFile=lr_bs.cntk makeMode=false deviceId=auto
```

Near the beginning of the output you should see a line confirming a GPU was used:

```
Model has 9 nodes. Using GPU 0.
```

Note that GPU ID may be different. The `deviceId` parameter defines what processor to use for computation.
* `deviceId=-1` means use CPU. Default value
* `deviceId=X` where X is an integer >=0 means use GPU X, i.e. `deviceId=0` means GPU 0, etc.
* `deviceId=auto` means use GPU, select GPU automatically

### Trying the CNTK Python API

We assume that you created a CNTK Python environment (either through the [install script](./Setup-Windows-Binary-Script.md) or [manually](./Setup-CNTK-on-Windows.md#optional-anaconda-python-installation). Open a command prompt and activate your CNTK Python environment, e.g., by executing

```
activate cntk-py35
```

As a quick test change into the `Tutorials\NumpyInterop` folder and run `python FeedForwardNet.py`. After training you should see an output similar to this:

```
Finished Epoch [1]: loss = 0.297748 * 25600 2.383s (10742.8 samples per second)
 error rate on an unseen minibatch 0.040000
```
