# CNTK Library API C#

The CNTK Library Managed Eval API is implemented in C#, and can be consumed by C# and other .NET languages. The page [Using the CNTK Library Managed API](./CNTK-Library-Evaluation-on-Windows.md#using-cnet-managed-api) presents how to use this API in your application. The following sections describe the classes and methods of the CNTK Library Managed Eval API.

## class Function

A `Function` denotes a symbolic computation with zero or more input arguments and one or more outputs. A Function may be primitive or composite (comprised of other Function instances whose inputs and outputs are wired together). A Function effectively is a computation graph composed of other primitive Functions (denoting computation) as nodes and [`Variable`](#class-variable) objects (denoting data) as the edges and leaves of the graph.

The `Function` class contains the following properties and methods that are relevant to evaluation:

***
`public string Name { get; }`

Name of 'this' Function.

***
`public IList<Variable> Arguments { get; }`

List of all input Variables of 'this' Function that are not of type Parameter or Constant. These Variables are required inputs in order to compute the outputs of the Function. 

***
`public Variable Output { get; }`

The single output Variable of 'this' Function, if there is only one. Otherwise a runtime exception is raised on access. 

***
`public IList<Variable> Outputs { get; }`

List of all output Variables of 'this' Function.

***
`public Function RootFunction { get; }`

Returns the primitive Function at the root of the graph of Functions underlying 'this' Function. If 'this' Function itself is a primitive Function, then (this->RootFunction() == this).

***
`public string OpName { get; }`

The name of the operation that 'this' Function denotes.

***
`public bool IsComposite { get; }`

A boolean value indicating whether 'this' Function is a composite Function.

***
`public bool IsPrimitive { get; }`

A boolean value indicating whether 'this' Function is a primitive Function.

***
`public bool IsBlock { get; }`

A boolean value indicating whether 'this' Function is a block Function.

***
`public void Evaluate(IDictionary<Variable, Value> inputs, IDictionary<Variable, Value> outputs, DeviceDescriptor computeDevice)`

Evaluates the Function using the specified _arguments_ as input. It computes the outputs of the Function based on the [Values](#class-value) provided for each input variable specified in the _inputs_ dictionary. The outputs are stored in the output Values corresponding to the output variables in the _outputs_ dictionary.

Parameters:
*  _inputs_: the input variables and their values of the Function.
*  _outputs_: output values for each output variable. The caller may specify the Value object for storing the output or pass _null_ in which case the function allocates the storage for the output results. In both cases, on return the Value object contains the result of the corresponding output of the Function. If a _null_ Value was specified, the Value object returned by the method is temporary and only guaranteed to be valid until the next Forward/Backward call. If it needs to be accessed later, you should use the Evaluate() method below which allows you to create persistent Value objects, or you must explicitly _DeepClone_ the temporary Value object.
*  _computeDevice_: the device on which the computation is executed. It should be aligned with the device on which the model is loaded.

***
`public void Evaluate(IDictionary<Variable, Value> inputs, IDictionary<Variable, Value> outputs, bool createPersistentOutputValues, DeviceDescriptor computeDevice)`

Evaluates the Function using the specified _arguments_ as input. It computes the outputs of the Function based on the [Values](#class-value) provided for each input variable specified in the _inputs_ dictionary. The outputs are stored in the output Values corresponding to the output variables in the _outputs_ dictionary.

Parameters:
*  _inputs_: the input variables and their values of the Function.
*  _outputs_: output values for each output variable. The caller may specify the Value object for storing the output or pass _null_ in which case the method allocates the storage for the output results. In both cases, on return the Value object contains the result of the corresponding output of the Function. If a _null_ Value was specified, and _createPersistentOutputValues_ is false, the Value object returned by the method is temporary and only guaranteed to be valid until the next Forward/Backward call.
* _createPersistentOutputValues_: Only relevant if a _null_ Value was specified in outputs. If it is set to _true_, the method will create persistent Value objects, otherwise the Value objects are temporary and are only valid until the next Forward/Backward call.
*  _computeDevice_: the device on which the computation is executed. It should be aligned with the device on which the model is loaded.

***
`public Function Clone(ParameterCloningMethod parameterCloneMethod = ParameterCloningMethod.Share)`

Clones 'this' Function.

Parameters:
*  _parameterCloneMethod_: specifies how the parameters of Function are cloned: `ParameterCloningMethod.Share` - Parameters are shared between the Function being cloned and the new clone. This value should be used if the cloned Function is used for concurrent evaluation. `ParameterCloningMethod.Clone` - New learnable Parameters are created and initialized with the current values of the corresponding Parameters of the Function being cloned. `ParameterCloningMethod.Freeze` - Parameters are cloned and made immutable; i.e. Constants in the new clone (e.g. for use as a fixed feature extractor). ParameterCloningMethod is defined [here](#enum-parametercloningmethod).

***
`public Function FindByName(string name, bool nestedSearchInsideBlockFunction)`

*  _nestedSearchInsideBlockFunction_: if it is true, all functions inside block functions are also examined.

***
`public IList<Function> FindAllWithName(string name, bool nestedSearchInsideBlockFunction = false)`

`public static Function Combine(IEnumerable<Variable> operands)`

 Creates a new Function instance which combines the outputs of the specified list of 'operands' of Functions. The 'Outputs' of the new 'Function' are union of the 'Outputs' of each of the specified 'operands' Functions. As an example, when creating a classification model, typically the CrossEntropy loss Function and the ClassificationError Function comprise the roots of the computation graph which can be "Combine"d to create a single Function with 2 outputs; viz. CrossEntropy loss and ClassificationError output.
