# Tutorials

There are tutorials for Python users and for BrainScript users.

### Python Jupyter Notebook (**Recommended**)

Assuming you have completed [Getting Started](https://www.cntk.ai/pythondocs/gettingstarted.html), use
CNTK Python Jupyter notebook [tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/cognitive-toolkit/tutorials?view=cntk-py-2.0) to gain familiarity with the toolkit. You may want to start with the CNTK_1## series tutorials before trying out higher series that cover a range of different application including image classification, language understanding, reinforcement learning and others. 

Additional Python recipes: 
* ['Build your own image classifier using Transfer Learning'](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki/Build-your-own-image-classifier-using-Transfer-Learning) provides two examples for custom image classifiers using transfer learning.

You can also try out the tutorials live with pre-installed CNTK in [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/CNTK/libraries/tutorials) for free.

### BrainScript 

Assuming you have completed [Getting Started](./Tutorial/Tutorial.md), you can gain familiarity with more advanced use cases involving [image recognition](./Hands-On-Labs-Image-Recognition.md), [object detection with Fast R-CNN](./Object-Detection-using-Fast-R-CNN.md) and [language understanding / text classification](./Hands-On-Labs-Language-Understanding.md).

<!---
* [Getting Started](./Tutorial/Tutorial): Simple Logistic Regression and multi-class classification
* [Image Recognition](./Hands-On-Labs-Image-Recognition): Image recognition on CIFAR-10 with Convolutional and Residual Networks
* [Language Understanding with ATIS](./Hands-On-Labs-Language-Understanding): Slot tagging and intent classification with Recurrent Networks
* [Object Detection using Fast R-CNN](./Object-Detection-using-Fast-R-CNN): Object detection in images using the Fast R-CNN algorithm

Additional Python tutorials:
* The folder [Tutorials/NumpyInterop](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/master/Tutorials/NumpyInterop) contains a simple example of how to use numpy arrays as input for CNTK training and evaluation.
