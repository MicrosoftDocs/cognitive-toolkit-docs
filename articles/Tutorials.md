# Tutorials & Examples

## Tutorials

### Python Jupyter Notebook (Recommended)
Assuming you have completed [Getting Started](https://www.cntk.ai/pythondocs/gettingstarted.html), use the
CNTK Python Jupyter notebook [tutorials](https://cntk.ai/pythondocs/tutorials.html) to gain familiarity with the toolkit. You may want to start with the CNTK 100 series tutorials before trying out higher series that cover a range of different applications including image classification, language understanding, reinforcement learning and others. 

### Additional Python recipes: 
* ['Build your own image classifier using Transfer Learning'](./Build-your-own-image-classifier-using-Transfer-Learning.md) provides two examples for custom image classifiers using transfer learning.
* ['Object detection using Fast R-CNN'](./Object-Detection-using-Fast-R-CNN.md) describes how to train Fast R-CNN on PASCAL VOC data and custom data for object detection.
* ['Object-Detection-using-Faster-R-CNN'](./Object-Detection-using-Faster-R-CNN.md) describes how to train Faster R-CNN on PASCAL VOC data and custom data for object detection.

You can also try out the tutorials live with pre-installed CNTK in [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/CNTK/libraries/tutorials) for free.

## Examples
Refer to [Examples](./Examples.md) to find examples of building networks in CNTK using the supported APIs.

### BrainScript 

Assuming you have completed [Getting Started](./Tutorial/Tutorial.md), you can gain familiarity with more advanced use cases involving [image recognition](./Hands-On-Labs-Image-Recognition.md), [object detection with Fast R-CNN](./Object-Detection-using-Fast-R-CNN.md) and [language understanding / text classification](./Hands-On-Labs-Language-Understanding.md).

* [Getting Started](./Tutorial/Tutorial): Simple Logistic Regression and multi-class classification
* [Image Recognition](./Hands-On-Labs-Image-Recognition): Image recognition on CIFAR-10 with Convolutional and Residual Networks
* [Language Understanding with ATIS](./Hands-On-Labs-Language-Understanding): Slot tagging and intent classification with Recurrent Networks
* [Object Detection using Fast R-CNN](./Object-Detection-using-Fast-R-CNN): Object detection in images using the Fast R-CNN algorithm
