# The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit

The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit - CNTK - is a unified deep-learning toolkit by Microsoft. [This video](https://youtu.be/9gDDO5ldT-4) provides a high-level overview of the toolkit.

The latest release of the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit is [2.1](./ReleaseNotes/CNTK_2_1_Release_Notes.md).

CNTK can be included as a library in your Python or C++ programs, or used as a standalone machine learning tool through its own model description language (BrainScript). In addition you can use the CNTK model evaluation functionality from your C# or Java program.

CNTK supports 64-bit Linux or 64-bit Windows operating systems. To install you can either choose pre-compiled binary packages, or compile the toolkit from the source provided in GitHub.
