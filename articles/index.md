# The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit

The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit - CNTK - is a unified deep-learning toolkit by Microsoft. [This video](https://youtu.be/9gDDO5ldT-4) provides a high-level view of the toolkit. 

The latest release of the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit is [2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/ReleaseNotes/CNTK_2_0_Release_Notes). 

It can be included as a library in your Python or C++ programs, or used as a standalone machine learning tool through its own model description language (BrainScript). CNTK supports 64-bit Linux or 64-bit Windows operating systems. To install you can either choose pre-compiled binary packages, or compile the Toolkit from the source provided in GitHub.

Here are a few pages to get started:
* [Reasons to switch from TensorFlow to CNTK](./Reasons-to-Switch-from-TensorFlow-to-CNTK.md)
* [Setting up CNTK on your machine](./Setup-CNTK-on-your-machine.md)
* [Tutorials](./Tutorials.md), [Examples](./Examples.md), etc..
  * Try the [tutorials on Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/cntk/libraries/tutorials) with **pre-installed** CNTK 
* [The CNTK Library APIs](./CNTK-Library-API.md)
  * [Using CNTK from Python](https://cntk.ai/pythondocs)

* Give us feedback through these [channels](Feedback-Channels.md)

## June 2017
***2017-06-01.* CNTK 2.0**  
The first production release of Cognitive Toolkit 2.0.

Highlights:
* CNTK backend for Keras.
* Extremely fast binary convolution with Halide.
* Java API.
* A new set of NuGet Packages.
* Multiple bug fixes.

See more in the [Release Notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/ReleaseNotes/CNTK_2_0_Release_Notes).

## May 2017
***2017-05-24.* CNTK 2.0 Release Candidate 3**  
Release Candidate 3 is the final preview of Cognitive Toolkit v.2.0.

Highlights:
* API that were previously declared deprecated are now ***removed***. See details in [release notes](./ReleaseNotes/CNTK_2_0_RC_3_Release_Notes.md). 
* Introduction of CNTK Java API in experimental mode. See details in [release notes](./ReleaseNotes/CNTK_2_0_RC_3_Release_Notes.md).
* New operators like `to_sequence` and `sequence.unpack`.
* Support of convolution in 1D. 
* Support of UDF serialization (available both in Python and native in C++).
* New tools ([Crosstalk](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/master/bindings/python/cntk/contrib/crosstalk) and [RNN Conversion](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/master/bindings/python/cntk/misc/optimized_rnnstack_converter.py)).
* Support of NVIDIA cuDNN v.6.0 when CNTK is built by the user from source code.
* A new set of NuGet Packages.
* Multiple bug fixes.

***2017-04-21.* CNTK 2.0 Release Candidate 2**  
With Release Candidate 2 we reacted to customer feedback and improved/added features, functionality, and performance.

Highlights:
* New operators like `pow`, `sequence.reduce_max`, `sequence.softmax`.
* New feature for Linux source builds (GPU Direct RDMA support in distributed gradients aggregation, NCCL support for Python in V2 gradients aggregation).
* Support for Python 3.6 for source and binary installation; see [here](./Setup-CNTK-on-your-machine.md).
* `UserMinibatchSource` to write custom minibatch sources; see [here](https://cntk.ai/pythondocs/extend.html#user-defined-minibatch-sources).
* New C# APIs: `class NDArrayView` and methods, `SetMaxNumCPUThreads()`, `GetMaxNumCPUThreads()`, `SetTraceLevel()`, `GetTraceLevel()`
* A new set of NuGet Packages is provided with this Release.

***2017-03-31.* CNTK 2.0 Release Candidate 1**
With Release Candidate 1 the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit enters the final set of enhancements before release of the production version of CNTK 2.0. 

Highlights:
* The release candidate contains [all changes and improvements introduced in CNTK 2.0 during beta phase](./CNTK-2.0-Beta-Highlights.md).
* Enables Caffe-converted pretrained models on image classification including AlexNet, ResNet, VGG and BN-Inception. 
* Slice now supports multiple-axis slicing.
* Improves performance and memory footprint
* Improvements in the [device selection API](./ReleaseNotes/CNTK_2_0_RC_1_Release_Notes.md).
* New Python [model debugging functions](https://cntk.ai/pythondocs/cntk.debugging.html#module-cntk.debugging.debug).
* Improvements in Python and C# API. See the [release notes](./ReleaseNotes/CNTK_2_0_RC_1_Release_Notes.md) for detailed description.
* New file names for [CNTK libraries and DLLs](./CNTK-Shared-Libraries-Naming-Format.md).
