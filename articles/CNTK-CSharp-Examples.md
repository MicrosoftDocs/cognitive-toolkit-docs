# CNTK C#/.NET API training examples

## Overview
CNTK repository contains [examples](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/release/latest/Examples/TrainingCSharp) using CNTK C# API to build, train, and evaluate CNTK neural network models. 

#### [LogisticRegression](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/release/latest/Examples/TrainingCSharp/Common/LogisticRegression.cs)
A hello-world example to train and evaluate a logistic regression model using C#/API. See [CNTK 101: Logistic Regression and ML Primer](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/release/latest/Tutorials/CNTK_101_LogisticRegression.ipynb) for more details.
#### [MNISTClassifier](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/release/latest/Examples/TrainingCSharp/Common/MNISTClassifier.cs) 
This class shows how to build and train a classifier for handwritting data (MNIST).  
#### [CifarResNetClassifier](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/release/latest/Examples/TrainingCSharp/Common/CifarResNetClassifier.cs) 
This class shows how to do image classification using ResNet.
The model being built is a lite version of [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385). See [Python Tutorials](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/release/latest/Tutorials/CNTK_201B_CIFAR-10_ImageHandsOn.ipynb) for more details.
#### [TransferLearning](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/release/latest/Examples/TrainingCSharp/Common/TransferLearning.cs) 
This class demonstrates transfer learning using a pretrained ResNet model. 
See [Python Tutorials](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/release/latest/Tutorials/CNTK_301_Image_Recognition_with_Deep_Transfer_Learning.ipynb) for more details. 
#### [LSTMSequenceClassifier](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/release/latest/Examples/TrainingCSharp/Common/LSTMSequenceClassifier.cs) 
This class shows how to build a recurrent neural network model from ground up and how to train the model.
