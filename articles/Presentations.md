* Sayan Pathak **Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) Deep Dive and Hands-on Tutorial - Nov 2016** This [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl-kbFJ1KzU) goes from a high level view, to an intermediate level of detail and then to hands-on tutorials. The first half is a talk and slideware. The later half is hands-on tutorials

* [KDD 2016](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/): *Frank Seide and Amit Agarwal* presented a tutorial titled,  "**CNTK: Microsoft's Open-Source Deep-Learning Toolkit**" on August 16, 2016. Tutorial description [here](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/tutorials/view/cntk), Prerequisites page [here](./KDD-2016-Tutorial.md); slides [here](https://cntk.ai/kdd/CNTK-Hands-On-KDD2016-Frank-Seide-and-Amit-Agarwal.zip); video [here, note: 3 parts](http://videolectures.net/kdd2016_tutorial_deep_learning_toolkit/).
This 3-hour hands-on tutorial covers the following topics:
    * *what*: ...is CNTK? Including an introduction into the core concept of CNTK, the "computational network."
    * *how*: ...does a typical use of CNTK look like? Configuration of key components, workflow.
    * *deep dive*: ...into unique CNTK technologies. Automatic unrolling of time & efficient minibatching of variable-length sequences; data-parallel training with 1-bit SGD and Block Momentum.
    * *hands-on tutorials*:
      * *hello world*: getting set up, running a first logistic regression task
      * *language understanding*: slot and intent tagging on the ATIS language-understanding corpus. [Available online](./Hands-On-Labs-Language-Understanding.md)
      * *image recognition*: with convolutional nets, batch normalization,
        and residual networks using the CIFAR-10 corpus [Available online](./Hands-On-Labs-Image-Recognition.md)
