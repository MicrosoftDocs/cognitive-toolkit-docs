# Getting Started With the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit

In this section the different ways to [install CNTK from precompiled binaries](./Setup-CNTK-on-your-machine.md) are explained. If you want to build CNTK from source code, the required steps are described [here](./Setup-CNTK-from-source.md).

Once you installed CNTK, we recommend you try the [tutorial](./Tutorials.md) or [example](./Examples.md) sections of the documentation.

You may use CNTK via Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine offering (Windows and Linux) or install it as a Docker container (Linux). See the corresponding sections:

* [CNTK on Azure](./CNTK-on-Azure.md)
* [CNTK Docker Containers](./CNTK-Docker-Containers.md)

If you want to use Keras together with CNTK, you will find the required information [here](./Using-CNTK-with-Keras.md).
