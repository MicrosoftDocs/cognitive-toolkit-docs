## Interpret the use of MinibatchSource.next_minibatch

**TODO** This material applies to all of CNTK and should move to a common location

My current understanding is that when I call MinibatchSource.next_minibatch(minibatch_size, input_map) during training it will pick a random subset of minibatch_size samples from my training data set?

**Yes**

Does the implementation ensure that when I call next_minibatch N times (N = number_of_training_samples / minibatch_size) my whole data set gets covered at the end of the N calls of next_minibatch? Also, when I call next_minibatch `2*N` times does it means that my whole training set gets covered twice?

**Yes**.

**Additional info:**
* Each cycle through the data will have a different random order.
* If you double your minibatch size, one minibatch will now contain exactly the samples that, before, the corresponding two consecutive minibatches would have contained (this may be approximate if you have variable-length sequences). I.e. two runs that only differ in MB size process the data in the same order.
* If you interrupt and restart from checkpoint, you will get the same random order as if you had not interrupted.

This is implemented by grounding the reading/randomization process on a nominal time axis, with this simple algorithm:

* Training proceeds on a nominal infinite time axis. If you fetch a MB of size 256, the nominal time progresses by 256.
* The training corpus is replicated an infinite number of times on this time axis. If you have M samples, then the first replica spans nominal time 0..M-1; the second M..2M-1; etc.
* Each replica is random-shuffled within, but not across replica boundaries. I.e. once you have processed precisely M samples, you have seen each sample exactly once.
* Calling next_minibatch(K) gives you the next K samples on this reshuffled infinite time line. Itâ€™s the same as calling next_minibatch(1) for K times.
* This is all done lazily.
* Restarting from checkpoint is as simple as resetting the nominal time to the nominal time when the checkpoint was created.

## Load pre trained checkpointed model and continue retraining

You have a CNTK `trainer` object and save a checkpoint file.
  
    checkpoint_file = "mModel_checkpointed.dnn"
    trainer.save_checkpoint(checkpoint_file)

At a later time I load the `".dnn"` file as my model

    mymodel.load_model(checkpoint_file)

When you restart training and it would load the model but not the weights. To be able to restore training from the previously checkpointed model. You need to use [`trainer.restore_from_checkpoint`](https://cntk.ai/pythondocs/cntk.trainer.html?highlight=restore_from_checkpoint#cntk.trainer.Trainer.restore_from_checkpoint) instead, to recreate the trainer and learners. One important thing is that in your Python script the order of network creation (not only structure! but the order in which you create your nodes) should stay the same at the point when you create a checkpoint and when you restore from it.

## Relate alpha, beta1, beta2 and epsilon to learning rate and momentum in adam_sgd

* Alpha is the learning_rate
* Beta1 is momentum parameter
* Beta2 is variance_momentum parameter

## Train two or more models jointly

There are two cases that this can arise. One is multitask learning the other is you have one processing pipeline for some part of your input and another pipeline for the other. 

  * Multitask learning is when you have multiple criteria you want your network to be good at. The standard way to deal with this is to construct a single number out of all these criteria. For example
```python
cross_entropy = cross_entropy_with_softmax(predictions, labels)
reconstruction_error = squared_error(reconstruction, features)
combined_loss = 0.3 * reconstruction_error + cross_entropy
```
  * Multiple pipelines such as the one below are also tricky 
```python
q_embed = qmodel(question)
a_embed = amodel(answer)
```

The trainer takes a single function whose parameters should be modified by the training procedure. How can we pass the union of `qmodel` and `amodel` or the union of `cross_entropy` and `reconstruction_error`? The answer is to find a point where all the parameters are part of the same function. That happens at the very least in the final loss.
i.e. `loss.parameters` contains all parameters the loss depends on. Typically however our model should not 
include the loss, as it only makes sense for training. Therefore a better approach is to use combine to create a combined model
```python 
final_model = combine(predictions, reconstruction)
```
For the separate pipeline case there is probably a place where everything gets combined
```python 
qa_score = score(q_embed,a_embed)
```
then `qa_score` can play the role of `final_model` above.

## Train with a weighted loss

The specification of a per-example weight in the loss is as simple as
```python
weight = input_variable((1))
weighted_loss = weight * loss
```
where `loss` is any builtin or user-defined loss function. Of course during training each minibatch will need to have a mapping from weight to actual values (one for each example).

## Train a multilabel classifier in Python

For multilabel classification you should avoid using CrossEntropy as it can only handle input vectors that sum to 1. A sensible alternative is to use hamming loss.

```python
def my_hamming_loss:
    y = placeholder()
    p = placeholder()
    hammingLoss = reduce_sum (not_equal (y, (greater (p, 0.5))))
    return hammingLoss 
```
which you then can call as hammingLoss(labels, prob) and pass as the error metric to the Trainer.
