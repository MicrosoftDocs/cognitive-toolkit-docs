# Feedback Channels

As a development team we want to be present on many channels. We ask CNTK users to utilize the appropriate chanel to post issues or questions regarding the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit. We hope to avoid answers to similar questions on different chanels. This page describes how the Microsoft team intends to use the different channels.

## GitHub issues

[GitHub issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/issues) should be used for bugs and feature requests. We will therefore redirect general 'how-to' questions to [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cntk). Release announcements, roadmaps, etc. will be posted on GitHub.

## Stack Overflow

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cntk) is the best place for general question. Many community members are already on Stack Overflow and provide great answers to 'how-to' questions. Please use the [`cntk` tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cntk) when posting your CNTK related question.

## Gitter Chat

[Gitter Chat](https://gitter.im/Microsoft/CNTK) can be used for general questions and shorter programming questions.
