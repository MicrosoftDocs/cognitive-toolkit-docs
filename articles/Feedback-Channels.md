As a development team we want to be present on many channels ([GitHub issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/issues) and [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cntk)). We want to be responsive and at the same time be effective, for example, we want to avoid having to provide the same answer on different channels. This page describes how the development team intends to use and be active on the different channels.

# Github issues 
[Github issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/issues) should be used for bugs and feature requests. We will therefore redirect general 'how-to' questions to [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cntk). 

# Stack overflow 
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cntk) is the best place for getting high quality answers. Many community members are already on Stack Overflow and provide great answers to 'how-to' questions. A development team member tracks stack overflow for questions without an answer and jumps in as needed. 
Therefore please do not be upset when we close an issue with the comment to ask a question on Stack Overflow.
Finally, ensure to use [`cntk` tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cntk) when posting your CNTK related question.
