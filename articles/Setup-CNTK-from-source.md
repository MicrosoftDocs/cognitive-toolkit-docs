# CNTK Source Code and Development

The complete source code of the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit is published on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/Microsoft/CNTK). If you plan on building CNTK yourself you will need to [setup a local CNTK development environment](./Setup-development-environment). Information about **developing and testing** is [available here](./Developing-and-Testing). Finally, if you want to **contribute** your development efforts back into the CNTK community, you will find this [page](./Contributing-to-CNTK) useful.
