# ConvertDBN command

This command is used to convert a model generated by Microsoftâ€™s dbn.exe tool to a CNTK model. This command is useful when you want to compare the performance of these two tools (dbn.exe only supports simple fully connected deep neural networks), port existing models trained with dbn.exe to CNTK, or if you want to use the RBM pre-training which is available in dbn.exe but not in CNTK right now. The related parameters are
* `modelPath`: the full path of the generated CNTK model.

* `dbnModelPath`: the full path of the model to be converted.
