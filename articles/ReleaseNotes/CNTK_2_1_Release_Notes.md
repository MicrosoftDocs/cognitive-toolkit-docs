## CNTK v.2.1 Release Notes

This is a summary of changes and new features in the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit V.2.1.

### Highlights of this Release

* cuDNN 6.0 integration
* Support of Universal Windows Platform (UWP)
* Improvements in the CNTK Keras backend
* Performance improvements
* New manuals, tutorials and examples
* Bug fixes

## Breaking changes

This release contains the following **breaking changes**:

* Updated ROI pooling to match Caffe implementation. The signature has the following updates:
  * the parameters `pooling_type` and `spatial_scale` were added, and
  * the coordinates for the parameters `rois` are now absolute to the original image size
* C++ API. `NDShape::Unknown` was changed to `NDShape::Unknown()` to remove a static variable from the header.

## New and updated features

* Preview of Reinforcement learning framework for CNTK. See details [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/release/2.1/bindings/python/cntk/contrib/deeprl/README.md). Please, be aware, that this is the first preview, and many changes are likely in the future
* More flexible Python-based user deserializer. See the [manual](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/release/2.1/Manual/Manual_How_to_write_a_custom_deserializer.ipynb) for detailed information
* Caffe to CNTK model converter. See the [Converter ReadMe](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/release/2.1/bindings/python/cntk/contrib/crosstalkcaffe/README.md). Examples illustrating the usage of the converter are available in [CNTK Codebase](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/release/2.1/bindings/python/cntk/contrib/crosstalkcaffe/examples). 
* Reduction over multiple axes:
  * Computes the mean of the input tensor's elements across the specified axis
  * Computes the mean of the input tensor's elements across a specified axis or a list of specified axes 
* Support of Universal Windows Platform (UWP) in CNTK Evaluation library (see section below)
* New and improved features in the CNTK Keras backend (see section below)

### NVIDIA cuDNN 6.0 integration

GPU editions of CNTK Version 2.1 on Windows and Linux are shipped with the [NVIDIA CUDA Deep Neural Network library (cuDNN) v.6.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn). This improves CNTK performance with networks like ResNet 50 by about 10%.

If you build CNTK from source, you should also install NVIDIA cuDNN 6.0, since it is now the default for CNTK build and test on [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/Setup-CNTK-on-Windows#cudnn) and [Linux]((https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/Setup-CNTK-on-Linux#cudnn)).

### CNTK Evaluation library. Support of Universal Windows Platform (UWP)

With this release we introduce the support of [Universal Windows Platform (UWP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/whats-a-uwp). A new CNTK NuGet Package *[CNTK, UWP CPU-Only Build](http://www.nuget.org/packages/CNTK.UWP.CPUOnly)* is available for download. For further details see the description of [Model Evaluation on Universal Windows Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/CNTK-Library-Evaluation-on-UWP). To build the CNTK UWP evaluation library, see the description [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/Setup-UWP-Build-on-Windows).

### CNTK backend for Keras

Version 2.1 introduces the following improvements for the [CNTK backend for Keras](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/Using-CNTK-with-Keras):

* Stateful recurrent network support
* Support of Recurrent layer with mask
* Fixing batch normalization layer issue

### Performance improvements

* ResNet 50 performance improvement (reduce memcpy and memset during training). Expect single machine training speed to improve by about 8%
* Improvements in CNTK reader by index caching
* We have successfully tested CNTK ability to train ResNet 50 and Inception V3 with large minibatch size as the proposed in a [recent paper]( https://research.fb.com/publications/imagenet1kin1h/). This confirms CNTK ability of minibatch scaling not only for speech, but for image tasks as well
