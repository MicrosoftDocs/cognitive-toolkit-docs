# CNTK_2_0_Beta_2_Release_Notes

In this Release we have further tuned different features based on the overwhelming feedback on Beta 1 and have fixed several bugs. You are not required to adopt your code or models to take an advantage of these improvements.

## Improvements in the Examples and Tutorials and new Tutorial on Reinforcement Learning

Based on your feedback we have made some changes in the examples and tutorials. We have added a new [Tutorial on Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/v2.0.beta2.0/bindings/python/tutorials/CNTK_203_Reinforcement_Learning_Basics.ipynb) implemented as a Jupyter Notebook.
