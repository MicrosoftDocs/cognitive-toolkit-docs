# CNTK Evaluate Multiple Models

## Overview
The CNTK EvalDll library (`Cntk.Eval` and its .Net wrapper `Cntk.Eval.Wrapper` in Windows and `libCntk.Eval` in Linux) enables programmatic single threaded evaluation of CNTK models (concurrent evaluations of a single model instance is not supported).
However, it is possible to load multiple instances of a model and evaluate each model with a single thread. This enables multiple models to be evaluated in parallel, yet each model with a single thread.

## Example
Refer to the `EvaluateMultipleModels` method in the [CSEvalClient](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/master/Examples/Evaluation/CSEvalClient) program for an example of a possible implementation for evaluating multiple models concurrently.
