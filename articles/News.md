# News
## January 2018

***2018-01-31.* CNTK 2.4**

Highlights:
* Moved to CUDA9, cuDNN 7 and Visual Studio 2017.
* Removed Python 3.4 support.
* Added Volta GPU and FP16 support.
* Better ONNX support.
* CPU perf improvement.
* More OPs.

See more in the [Release Notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/ReleaseNotes/CNTK_2_4_Release_Notes).
Get the Release from the [CNTK Releases page](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/releases).


***2018-01-22.*** CNTK support for CUDA 9

CNTK now supports CUDA 9/cuDNN 7. This requires an update to build environment to Ubuntu 16/GCC 5 for Linux, and Visual Studio 2017/VCTools 14.11 for Windows. With CUDA 9, CNTK also added a preview for 16-bit floating point (a.k.a FP16) computation.

Please check out the example of FP16 in ResNet50 [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/release/latest/Examples/Image/Classification/ResNet/Python/TrainResNet_ImageNet_Distributed.py)

Notes on FP16 preview:
* FP16 implementation on CPU is not optimized, and it's not supposed to be used in CPU inference directly. User needs to convert the model to 32-bit floating point before running on CPU.
* Loss/Criterion for FP16 training needs to be 32bit for accumulation without overflow, using cast function. Please check the example above.
* Readers do not have FP16 output unless using numpy to feed data, cast from FP32 to FP16 is needed. Please check the example above.
* FP16 gradient aggregation is currently only implemented on GPU using NCCL2. Distributed training with FP16 with MPI is not supported.
* FP16 math is a subset of current FP32 implementation. Some model may get Feature Not Implemented exception using FP16.
* FP16 is currently not supported in BrainScript. Please use Python for FP16.

To setup build and runtime environment on Windows:
* Install [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) with following workloads and components. From command line (use Community version installer as example):
    vs_community.exe --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NativeDesktop --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.ManagedDesktop --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.Universal --add Microsoft.Component.PythonTools --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.Tools.14.11
* Install [NVidia CUDA 9](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-90-download-archive?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64)
* From PowerShell, run:
    [DevInstall.ps1](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/release/latest/Tools/devInstall/Windows/DevInstall.ps1)
* Start VCTools 14.11 command line, run:
    cmd /k "%VS2017INSTALLDIR%\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64 --vcvars_ver=14.11
* Open [CNTK.sln](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/release/latest/CNTK.sln) from the VCTools 14.11 command line. Note that starting CNTK.sln other than VCTools 14.11 command line, would causes CUDA 9 [build error](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/163758/vs-2017-155-doesnt-support-cuda-9.html).

To setup build and runtime environment on Linux using docker, please build Unbuntu 16.04 docker image using Dockerfiles [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/release/latest/Tools/docker). For other Linux systems, please refer to the Dockerfiles to setup dependent libraries for CNTK.

* [Script driven setup](./Setup-CNTK-with-script-on-Windows.md): This gives you an mostly automated migration to Visual Studio 2015
