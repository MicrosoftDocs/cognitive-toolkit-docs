# CNTK Development Environment Setup

If you want to take a look at the CNTK source code, compile CNTK yourself, make changes to the CNTK codebase, or contribute these changes back to the community, these pages describe how to setup the development environment on your local system:

|Windows                  | Linux                   |
|:------------------------|:------------------------|
|[Script-driven development setup](./Setup-CNTK-with-script-on-Windows.md) |
|[Manual development setup](./Setup-CNTK-on-Windows.md) | [Manual development setup](./Setup-CNTK-on-Linux.md)

On Windows we recommend the script-driven development setup!
