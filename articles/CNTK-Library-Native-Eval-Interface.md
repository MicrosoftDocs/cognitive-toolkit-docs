# CNTK Library Eval C++ API

The C++ CNTK Library for Evaluation is based on [CNTK Library API](./CNTK-Library-Managed-API.md). The following methods are used to evaluate a model.

***
## Load a model

***
```cpp
static FunctionPtr CNTK::Function::Load(const std::wstring& modelFile, const DeviceDescriptor& computeDevice = DeviceDescriptor::UseDefaultDevice()
```

This method loads a model file and returns the pointer to the Function that represents the loaded model. A Function in CNTK denotes a computation graph composed of primitive Functions or composite functions with zero or more input arguments and one or more outputs. The `modelFile` is the model file path. The `computeDevice` specifies the device to run evaluation.

***
```cpp
static FunctionPtr CNTK::Function::Load(char *modelBuffer, size_t modelBufferLength, const DeviceDescriptor& computeDevice = DeviceDescriptor::UseDefaultDevice()
```

This method loads a model from a memory buffer and returns the pointer to the Function that represents the loaded model. The `modelBuffer` points to the buffer containing the serialized model content, and the `modelBufferLength` is the buffer length. The `computeDevice` specifies the device to run evaluation.

***
## Evaluate a Function

***
```cpp
void CNTK::Function::Evaluate(const std::unordered_map<Variable, ValuePtr>& arguments, std::unordered_map<Variable, ValuePtr>& outputs, const DeviceDescriptor& computeDevice = DeviceDescriptor::UseDefaultDevice()
```

This method starts evaluation of the `this` Function representing the model with specified parameters. The `arguments` contains values of all input variables required for evaluation, and the `outputs` store the values of output variables. The storage of output values can either be pre-allocated by the caller, or by the system if the ValuePtr mapping is passed as null by the caller. The `computeDevice` specifies the device to run evaluation.

***
## Create a Value using dense input

***
```cpp
template <typename ElementType> static ValuePtr CNTK::Value::CreateBatch(const NDShape& sampleShape, const std::vector<ElementType>& batchData, const DeviceDescriptor& device, bool readOnly = false
```

Creates a new Value object containing a batch of samples. The number of samples in the batch is the number of elements in `batchData` divided by the size of `sampleShape` (A runtime error occurs if the remainder is not zero). The created Value object contains a copy of the specified data in `batchData`. `ElementType` is the data type of the created Value object. Currently, `float` and `double` are supported.

Parameters:
* `sampleShape`: the tensor shape of the Value object.
* `batchData`: the data to be contained in the Value object.
* `device`: on which device the Value object should be created.
* `readOnly`: the Value object is read-only if this flag is `true`.

***
```cpp
template <typename ElementType> static ValuePtr CNTK::Value::CreateSequence(const NDShape& sampleShape, const std::vector<ElementType>& sequenceData, const DeviceDescriptor& device, bool readOnly = false
```

Creates a new Value object containing a sequence of samples. The created Value object contains a copy of the specified data in `sequenceData`. The sequence length is the number of elements in `sequenceData` divided by the size of `sampleShape` (A runtime error occurs if the remainder is not zero). The created sequence is a new sequence. `ElementType` is the data type of the created Value object. Currently, `float` and `double` are supported.

Parameters:
* `sampleShape`: the tensor shape of the Value.
* `sequenceData`: the data to be contained in the Value.
* `device`: on which device the Value object should be created.

```

Creates a new Value object containing a sequence of samples. The created Value object contains a copy of the specified data in `sequenceData`. The sequence length is the number of elements in `sequenceData` divided by the size of `sampleShape` (A runtime error occurs if the remainder is not zero). The sequenceStartFlag specifies whether this sequence is a new sequence or continuation of a previous sequence at the same index in the sequences list from a previous call to this method. `ElementType` is the data type of the created Value object. Currently, `float` and `double` are supported.

Parameters:
* `sampleShape`: the tensor shape of the Value.
* `sequenceData`: the data to be contained in the Value.
* `sequenceStartFlag`: `true` indicates that it is a new sequence. `false` means a continuation of a previous sequence.

***
```cpp
template <typename ElementType> static ValuePtr CNTK::Value::CreateBatchOfSequences(const NDShape& sampleShape, const std::vector<std::vector<ElementType>>& batchOfSequences, const DeviceDescriptor& device, bool readOnly = false
```

Creates a new Value object containing a batch of variable length sequences. The created Value object contains a copy of the specified data in `batchOfSequences`. The number of sequences in the batch is the size of `batchOfSequences`. The length of each sequence is the number of elements in the corresponding sequence of `batchOfSequences` divided by the size of `sampleShape` (A runtime error occurs if the remainder is not zero). Each sequence in `batchOfSequences` is a new sequence. `ElementType` is the data type of the created Value object. Currently, `float` and `double` are supported.

Parameters:
* `sampleShape`: the tensor shape of the Value.

***
## Copy data from a Value object

***
```cpp
template <typename ElementType> void CNTK::Value::CopyVariableValueTo(const Variable& outputVariable, std::vector<std::vector<ElementType>>& sequences
```

Copies the data stored in the Value into the buffer provided by `sequences`. The `sequences` is a list of sequences with variable length. The number of items contained in the outer list of `sequences` is the number of sequences in the Value. Each element of the outer list represents a sequence. Each sequence, represented by `vector<ElementType>`, contains a variable number of samples. Each sample consists of a fixed number of elements with type of `ElementType`. The number of elements of a sample is determined by the shape of `outputVariable`. The shape of the variable should match the shape of the Value. `ElementType` is the data type of the created Value object. Currently, `float` and `double` are supported.

Parameters:
* `outputVariable`: denotes the shape and dynamic axes when copying data from this Value to the `sequences`.
* `sequences`: the output buffer used to store the data copied from the Value.

***
```cpp
void CNTK::Value::CopyVariableValueTo(const Variable& outputVariable, std::vector<std::vector<size_t>>& sequences
```

Copies the data stored in the Value object into the buffer provided by `sequences`. The `sequences` is a list of sequences with variable length. The number of items contained in the outer list of `sequences` is the number of sequences in the Value. Each element of the outer list represents a sequence. Each sequence, represented by `vector<size_t>`, contains a variable number of samples. Each sample is represented by an index pointing to the non-zero value in the one-hot vector. The dimension size of the one-hot vector should match that defined in the `outputVariable`.

Parameters:
* `outputVariable`: denotes the shape and dynamic axes when copying data from this Value to the `sequences`.
* `sequences`: the output buffer used to store the data copied from the Value.

***
```cpp
template <typename ElementType> void CopyVariableValueTo(const Variable& outputVariable, size_t& sequenceLength, std::vector<SparseIndexType>& colStarts, std::vector<SparseIndexType>& rowIndices, std::vector<ElementType>& nonZeroValues, size_t& numNonZeroValues)
```

Copy the data stored in the Value object to the buffers representing a sequence in CSC sparse format. The sequence buffer will be resized if necessary. The Value should have the same tensor shape as outputVariable. On return, `sequenceLength` is set to the length of the sequence stored in the Value, and `colStarts`, `rowIndices` and `nonZeroValues` contain the data of column start indexes, row indexes and non-zero values, and `numNonZeroValues` is set to number of non-zero values contained in `this` Value.

Parameters:
* `outputVariable`: denotes the shape and dynamic axes when copying data from this Value to the buffers.
* `sequenceLength`: on return, it is set to the length of the sequence stored in the Value.
* `colStarts`: on return, it contains indices into the `nonZeorValues` of the first non-zero element of each column of the matrix.
* `rowIndices`: on return, it contains the row indexes of each non-zero element of the matrix.
* `nonZeroValues`: on return, it contains values of all non-zero elements of the matrix.
* `numNonZeroValues`: on return, it returns the number of non-zero elements of the matrix.

## Helper functions to manipulate the Function to be evaluated

***
```cpp
FunctionPtr CNTK::Function::Clone(ParameterCloningMethod parameterCloneMethod = ParameterCloningMethod::Clone, const std::unordered_map<Variable, Variable>& replacements = {}) const
```

For evaluation, this method is called to create a cloned Function which can then be used by another thread to evaluate the same model. For this purpose, the `parameterCloneMethod` should be set to its default value `ParameterCloningMethod::Share`. The parameter `replacements` specifies any variable replacements that are applied in the cloned Function instance, and is usually not needed for evaluation.

***
```cpp
FunctionPtr CNTK::Function::FindByName(const std::wstring& name, bool nestedSearchInsideBlockFunction = false
```

Find a function with the given `name` in the Function graph underlying 'this' Function. If more than one function with the same name exists, an exception is thrown. If `nestedSearchInsideBlockFunction` is true, all functions inside block functions are also searched.

***
```cpp
std::vector<FunctionPtr> CNTK::Function::FindAllWithName(const std::wstring& name, bool nestedSearchInsideBlockFunction = false
```

Find a list of functions with the given `name` in the Function graph underlying 'this' Function. If `nestedSearchInsideBlockFunction` is true, all functions inside block functions are also searched.

***
```cpp
FunctionPtr CNTK::Combine(const std::vector<Variable>& operands, const std::wstring& name = L""
```

 Create a new Function instance which combines the outputs of the specified list of 'operands' of Functions. The 'Outputs' of the new 'Function' are union of the 'Outputs' of each of the specified 'operands' Functions. As an example, when creating a classification model, typically the CrossEntropy loss Function and the ClassificationError Function comprise the roots of the computation graph which can be "Combine"d to create a single Function with 2 outputs; viz. CrossEntropy loss and ClassificationError output.

***
```cpp
FunctionPtr CNTK::AsComposite(const FunctionPtr& rootFunction, const std::wstring& name = L""
```

Creates a composite Function that has the specified `rootFunction` as its root. The composite denotes a higher-level Function encapsulating the entire graph of Functions underlying the specified `rootFunction`.

***
```cpp
FunctionPtr CNTK::Alias(const Variable& operand, const std::wstring& name = L""
```

Creates a new Function instance which is just an alias of the specified `operand`.

## Examples
The C++ examples [**CNTKLibraryCPPEvalCPUOnlyExamples**](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/release/latest/Examples/Evaluation/CNTKLibraryCPPEvalCPUOnlyExamples) and [**CNTKLibraryCPPEvalGPUExamples**](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/release/latest/Examples/Evaluation/CNTKLibraryCPPEvalGPUExamples) demonstrate the usage of CNTK Library for evaluation. The samples also show how to do multiple evaluations in parallel using multiple threads and share model parameters among threads.
